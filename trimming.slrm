# --clip_R1 9 --clip_R2 9 are added to remove the 9 bases that are genomic but filled in during bisulfite library construction
# These bases are 100% hypomethylated due to being filled in entirely with dCTPs during construction
# They are excluded to avoid artifical bias in DNA methylation level calculation, however, these bases are technically valid for mapping purposes
# A better approach would be to ignore these bases for DNA meth level calcutions in later processing

# unpaired reads are retained in case of any necessary analysis
# These can be discarded if disk storage space is an issue
